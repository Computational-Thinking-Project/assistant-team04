## Branches and ownership

Roster numbers indicate display order. Task numbers below follow the original
seven-task plan, so sorting the roster does not change task ownership.

| Task | Owner | Branch | Assigned files |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Nguyen Ba Duy | `feat/config` | `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` |
| 2 | Truong Thanh Dat | `feat/backend` | `src/assistant/__init__.py`, `src/assistant/rules.py`, `src/assistant/__main__.py` |
| 3 | Nguyen Nhat Quynh | `feat/scripts` | `scripts/check_env.py` |
| 4 | Ha Tran Boi Anh | `feat/data` | `data/offices.csv`, `data/README.md` |
| 5 | Nguyen Dinh Hung | `feat/tests` | `tests/test_smoke.py` |
| 6 | Duong Trung Anh | `feat/ui` | `ui/README.md` |
| 7 | Pham Khanh Tam | `feat/docs` | `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/team.md` |

This table records the planned skeleton assignment. The corresponding files
are delivered through their owners' separate PRs.

## Review and milestone responsibilities

Each member opens a PR from their branch into the team repository's `main`.
A teammate or the project manager reviews the change before merging. The
recommended merge order is config, backend, scripts, data, tests, UI, then docs.
After all seven PRs are merged and setup checks pass, the project manager
(Nguyen Ba Duy) creates and pushes the `v0.1-setup` tag.
